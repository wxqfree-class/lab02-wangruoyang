today, we will start to learn using vim editor.

when you firest start into vim, 
you will find that when you type some letters on your keyborad, 
the editor seems have no respones to your input, 

what happened? don't panic,
vim is a mode text editor which is very differnet from other text editors. 
when you start vim, you will into a special status which is named normal mode, 
in this mode, whatever you type are interpreted as a command instead of the content. 

then how can we begin to input our text? 
is is easy, just type letter i, which means the command insert, 
so you will be bring into the second status called insert mode, 
in this mode, you can input what you want to the file you are editing.

after adding some content to your file, you want to save your work, 
but you find that there is no save button avaible, you are in confusion again.

so it is time to tell you the final basic mode: the command-line mode.
first, you must press the <ESC> key on the left top of your keyboard.
the <ESC> key can bring you back to the normal mode from any mode immediately.
then you should type the letter : now.

you can see the : display on the bottom of the editor, 
which means you have got into the command-line mode.

in this mode, we can input some command and then press enter key to excute it.
for now, we want to save our file, 

so we can input w followed by a file name you want, for example, myfile.
then press the enter key, 
the content you just input in the insert mode will be saved to the file.
at the same time, you have gont back to the normal mode again.

you can repeat switching among these three modes,
modify your content and save your modifications again and again.

but if you have finished all your edit work, how to quit vim?
it is simple as well, 

you can return to the normal mode, 
and input : to go into the command-line mode,
then type wq to save and quit your work, 
or type q! to quit vim without saving your last modifications.
